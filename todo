[ ] Resuming a boil counts iterations incorrectly. It counts _all_ the files in .boil instead of only the pipeline files.
[ ] `boil --check` is incorrectly claiming success even though boiling is failing.
[ ] add `boil --hard` and `boil --soft` to make boil delete file(s) BEFORE starting a session:
    - "hard" mode should delete all files in the repo
    - "soft" mode should pick a random file and remove all it's lines.
    - both modes should run the test command first to ensure it works before deleting files. Save the output as part of the boil_start first commit.
[ ] get /root/viw boiling
    - add detectors and planners as needed
    - once it can `boil --hard` successfully, add `viw` to example_repos
[ ] if a source file has ERROR tokens in it, according to tree_print, do not attempt partial repairs. Just restore_full
[ ] get /root/viless boiling
