STARTER TASK
-------------
ok, please "cd /root/dim; boil make test".
The boil command will fail because it doesn't know how to handle the error.
The solution is "git checkout example.py" but boil doesn't know that.

Help write a handler function for boil to handle this case.
Only edit /root/boiler/handlers.py yourself.
DO NOT EDIT ANY OTHER FILE.

You can also call "boil --clear" to reset state in the dim repo.

Recommended iteration loop:
1. "boil make test"
2. inspect the log from that command and see why it failed
3. "git log HEAD..boiling" to see a list of commits that boil added while working.
    It uses the "boiling" branch, rather than changing HEAD
    You can "git show <commit>" to see the output of "make test" and any file changes boil attempted.
4. Based on the error output, and your knowledge of what the true fix is, modify /root/boiler/handlers.py to handle this error.
5. "boil --abort" to reset the session to the beginning, undoing any file changes boil make
6. "boil --clear" will dlete the "boiling" branch and ".boil" directory, but keep changes to working dir.



SECOND TASK
-----------

Iteration Loop:
Pick a random file in dim and delete it
"boil make test"
fix handlers.py until boil can make the repair on it's own
repeat with a new random file until boil can handle them all


THIRD TASK
----------

Iteration loop:
1. download neovim from github and get it's tests working
2. boil the repo while keeping the tests untouched
